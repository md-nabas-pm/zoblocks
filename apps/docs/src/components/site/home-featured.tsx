 * The six components the home page argues from.
 *
 * This replaces a twenty-seven cell grid. That grid had a fair claim to being
 * complete and no claim at all to being persuasive: each cell gave a component
 * about 150px of art, which is not enough for a date picker, a copilot or a
 * signature to be anything but a thumbnail — and several were rendering
 * clipped, which is worse than rendering small. A reader who has never met
 * this library needs to believe one component before being offered
 * twenty-seven.
 *
 * So: six, each at a size where the component is legible and operable, with
 * one sentence of claim rather than a paragraph of rationale. The full
 * catalogue is one link away and still lists everything.
 *
 * The six are not arbitrary. They are the components that already carry a
 * full gallery in this repo — the ones with enough states, variants and
 * clinical argument to survive being looked at closely.

      {/*
        `instrument-demo`, never bare `instrument`.

        Bare `instrument` paints the dark panel ground, and globals.css is
        explicit that it is reserved for deliberate contrast moments — the
        closing CTA is the only other user. A live component inside it renders
        its own light-theme tokens on a near-black field: "Date of service",
        "Start", "End" and "Contact precautions" all came out dark on dark, and
        the signature pad rendered as an empty box. The modifier remaps the
        panel tokens to the page theme, which is the whole reason it exists.

        It also carries its own background, border and radius, so the
        `bg-paper border border-rule rounded-2xl` that used to be here was both
        redundant and part of the fight.

        No minimum height.

        It had `min-h-[16rem]`, and measuring the rendered page showed every
        stage carrying between 130 and 175 pixels of nothing: a tabstrip is 83
        pixels tall and was being centred inside 256. That is the same void
        that made the state browser look unfinished, reintroduced one file
        later. A signature pad and a tabstrip are honestly different heights,
        and the stage should say so — the text column beside it is centred, so
        rows of unequal height still read as a set.
