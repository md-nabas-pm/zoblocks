        `whitespace-nowrap` with `overflow-x-auto` meant a command wider than

        "npx @zoblocks/cli…" of a 344px line in 279px, and on a phone less than
        three quarters of it. A scrollbar is not a disclosure — the reader has
        to discover there is more and then drag for it, and the thing hidden is
        the one instruction the page is asking them to run.

        These commands break at spaces, so wrapping lands between arguments
        rather than mid-token. `tabIndex` went with the overflow: it was there
        because a scrollable region must be reachable by keyboard (WCAG 2.1.1),
        and a non-scrolling, non-interactive element carrying a tab stop is one
        press between the reader and the Copy button for nothing.

/**
 * One observer for the whole page. Elements opt in with `data-reveal`; the CSS
 * handles the transition.
 *
 * Two rules earned by getting this wrong twice, both worth stating.
 *
 * **The sweep repeats.** It used to run `querySelectorAll` once, on mount, so
 * anything that arrived later was never observed. Every gallery switches
 * chapters with a control, so each chapter mounts long after that — and under
 * a CSS default of `opacity: 0` "never observed" means invisible, permanently.
 * Every chapter after the first, on every component page, was a blank slab. A
 * MutationObserver now re-runs the sweep whenever nodes are added.
 *
 * **Nothing is hidden until hiding is known to be reversible.** The fix for
 * the above was to hide an element as the observer began watching it, which
 * failed harder: an IntersectionObserver computes nothing while the document
 * is hidden, so a page opened in a background tab hid all 58 of its elements
 * and revealed none. The flag that switches hiding on is therefore written
 * from inside the **first delivered callback** — the only proof that
 * intersections are being computed at all — and a `visibilitychange` listener
 * covers the tab that starts hidden and is brought forward later.

/**
 * Put focus back where it came from when a dialog closes.

 * The obvious implementation — remember `document.activeElement` on open and
 * focus it again on close — has a hole that only shows in WebKit. Safari
 * follows the macOS convention of *not* focusing a `<button>` when you click
 * it, so `activeElement` is `<body>`, and `body.focus()` is a no-op. Focus
 * ends up nowhere: a keyboard reader who dismisses the dialog is returned to
 * the top of the document with no idea where they were.
 *
 * So `previous` is used only when it is a real element that is still in the
 * document, and the control that opens the dialog is the fallback. Both halves
 * matter. A dialog reachable by a keyboard shortcut can be opened from
 * anywhere, so returning to its trigger would be wrong when somebody was three
 * links down the page; and a dialog opened by a mouse click has no meaningful
 * "previous", so its trigger is the only sensible answer.
 *
 * Shared because there are two of these — the command menu and the notify
 * dialog — and a third copy is how one of them quietly keeps the bug.
