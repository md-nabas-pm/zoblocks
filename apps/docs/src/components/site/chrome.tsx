   * The composition is symmetric about its centre, so the header's 180° hover

              The reason they were hidden has gone: the two app links that took
              the room came out on 10 Sep 2026, so 375px now has slack. They
              stay hidden anyway, because the condition for hiding a control was
              never "no room" — it was that nothing is lost. GitHub is in the
              footer and the picker moves there below `sm`, so a phone reader
              reaches both, and a six-control bar at 375px is worse than a
              four-control one even when it fits.

              Nothing is lost, which is the condition for hiding it. The picker
              is light/dark only now, and both are preferences — a reader on a
              phone whose machine is dark already lands on dark, because the
              boot script follows `prefers-color-scheme` when nothing is stored.

              This used to say the opposite, and the reason is worth keeping:
              the picker carried high contrast, which is an accessibility
              control rather than a preference, so hiding it on small screens
              took it from the readers most likely to need it. High contrast is
              no longer offered here (see `lib/theme.ts`) — the 7:1 tokens and
              their audit are untouched, but nothing in the UI turns them on. If
              it ever returns to the picker, this exemption has to go with it. */}
