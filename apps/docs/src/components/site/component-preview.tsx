              child is a WCAG 2.1.1 failure the audit caught. A column with the

              width away from anything.

              The centring is `margin: auto` on the child rather than
              `justify-content: center` here, and that is the bug fix rather
              than a preference. Centred content taller than a scroll container
              overflows both edges, and the top edge of a scroll box cannot be
              reached: the data grid's stage held 583px in 384px, so the first
              200px — the whole chrome band — was painted above scrollTop 0 and
              nothing could scroll to it. An auto margin collapses to zero the
              moment the content stops fitting, so a tall scenario starts at its
              top and a short one still sits in the middle.
