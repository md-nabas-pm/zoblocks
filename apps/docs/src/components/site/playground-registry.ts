/**
 * Which components have a playground, as a plain module.
 *
 * Split out of `playground.tsx` because that file is `"use client"`, and a
 * client module may only hand the server components — calling an ordinary
 * function exported from one throws at render. The page needs this answer
 * while deciding whether to emit the section and its rail entry, which is
 * server work.
 *
 * A component appears here once `playground.tsx` has a renderer for it. The
 * `controls` declaration is not enough on its own: something has to know what
 * a sensible set of items or a sensible value looks like, and that is
 * editorial work rather than something derivable from a type.
