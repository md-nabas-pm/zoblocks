/**
 * The sitemap, derived from the catalog rather than listed by hand.

 * one nobody remembers — the page ships, gets linked from the index, and is
 * simply never submitted. Deriving it means adding a component adds its URL.
 *
 * `slug` comes from the component's `seo` when it has declared one, because
 * that is the URL the canonical tag on the page points at. Two different URLs
 * for the same page is the specific mistake a sitemap is supposed to prevent.

 * blocks and four marketplace packs are statically generated, reachable only by
 * clicking through an index, and appeared in no sitemap at all. They are among
 * the most link-worthy pages on the domain and were effectively unlisted.
 *
 * `shelf()` can fail — it reaches for a catalogue the console owns. A sitemap
 * that throws is a sitemap that 500s, so a failure drops the packs and keeps
 * every other URL rather than taking the whole file down with it.
