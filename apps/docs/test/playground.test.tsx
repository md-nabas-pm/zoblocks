/**
 * Every knob combination the playground can produce, rendered.
 *
 * The playground is the only place in this repository that assembles props
 * nobody wrote by hand, and it is driven by metadata rather than by a author
 * who tried each setting. That combination shipped two crashes: `methods`
 * received the string `"draw"` for a prop the component maps over, and
 * `as="nav"` received items shaped for a view switch, so Tabs threw the whole
 * documentation page away — the props table, the examples and the
 * accessibility notes all gone because a reader moved one select.
 *
 * Neither was reachable by any existing suite. The unit tests render the
 * components with props a person chose; the story suite renders the states a
 * person declared. Nothing rendered the cartesian product, which is exactly
 * what a reader clicking through a playground produces.
 *
 * So this walks it. Every single-knob setting, and then every pair, because
 * both shipped bugs were interactions rather than individual values.

 * playground that hid those would be documenting a smaller component than the
 * one that ships.
 *
 * What must never happen is the refusal taking the page with it. So every
 * combination has to leave the reader with one of two things: the component,
 * or an explanation of why not. A blank panel is the failure.
