# Architecture decision records

One file per decision, numbered, never edited after acceptance — a decision that
turns out wrong is superseded by a new record, not rewritten. The point is that
someone arriving in three years can read why the seam is where it is, including
the options that were rejected and what they cost.

Format: **Context** (the forces, stated honestly) → **Decision** (what we do)
→ **Consequences** (good, costs, and rejected alternatives).

## When a change needs an ADR

- A new runtime dependency in any shipped package ([0009](0009-supply-chain-and-component-constraints.md)).
- Anything that changes a public API's shape, a package boundary, or a
  distribution channel.
- Anything that adds a way for a component to reach the network, the
  environment, or the app.
- A new axis in the token system.

Everything else is a pull request.
