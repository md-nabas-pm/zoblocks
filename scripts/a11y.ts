/**
 * Accessibility audit.
 *
 * The site tells visitors that WCAG 2.2 AA is the bar and lists per-component
 * accessibility notes. Those were originally written from how the components
 * were built, not from test results — this makes the claim checkable, and the
 * first run found four real violations including a contrast failure on the
 * footer's own legal limitation statement.
 *
 * Both themes are audited: a token that passes on paper can fail on the dark
 * page, and the dark theme is a first-class surface here.
 *
 * Automated testing catches roughly a third of WCAG issues. This is a floor,
 * not a certificate — keyboard and screen-reader passes stay manual.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm a11y [baseUrl]
