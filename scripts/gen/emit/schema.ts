/**
 * Emits the JSON Schema documents the registry and `zoblocks.json` declare.
 *
 * Every document we publish carries a `$schema` pointing at
 * https://zoblocks.design/schema/. That URL has to resolve, or the field is
 * decoration that editors silently fail to fetch and a customer pinning it
 * gets a 404 in their build.
 *
 * Generated rather than hand-written for the same reason the registry is: the
 * file-kind vocabulary lives in `@zoblocks/cli`, and a schema that
 * enumerates those kinds by hand goes stale the first time one is added.
