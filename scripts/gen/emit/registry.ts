 * Emits the ZoBlocks registry: registry.json and one document per item under

 *
 * Two guarantees this build makes that a hand-written registry cannot:
 *
 *   1. Every published item's source is read from disk at build time, so the
 *      documented source and the shipped source cannot diverge.
 *   2. `tier: "pro"` never reaches public output. Commercial source leaking onto
 *      the CDN is a one-line mistake in a hand-maintained file and an
