/**
 * Every catalog component is documented, and documented live.
 *
 * The docs site degrades quietly. A component with no entry in `SCENARIOS`
 * renders "Live preview coming with the next release." A component with no
 * entry in `PREVIEW` renders four state chips in the space a component should
 * occupy. A component whose props the generator could not read renders an empty
 * props table. None of the three is an error, none fails a build, and all three
 * look like a decision somebody made.
 *
 * They were not decisions. At the point this file was written six of twelve
 * components had no live preview, six had no card art, and two — Switch and
 * Tabs, the two largest APIs in the library — documented zero props, because
 * the extractor only understood `export function` and both are
 * `export const X = forwardRef(...)`. The catalog said everything was fine.
 *
 * So the assertion is coverage itself. Adding a component to the catalog now
 * fails this test until it is actually documented, which is the moment the
 * author is in a position to do it.
