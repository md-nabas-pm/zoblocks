/**
 * Every gate CI runs must be runnable locally.
 *
 * `scripts/verify.sh` opens by asking whoever adds a CI step to add it here
 * too. That instruction held for a while and then stopped: CI grew a bundle
 * budget, a dependency audit, a synthetic-data scan, an accessibility audit and
 * a three-engine browser suite, and `verify` had four of the five missing. Each
 * gap was found the same way — a red pull request, fifteen minutes after a push,
 * for something that takes seconds to check on a laptop.
 *
 * A comment cannot enforce that. This can: it reads the workflow, reads the
 * script, and fails when a CI step is neither mapped to a local gate nor
 * explicitly declared as setup. Adding a step to `ci.yml` therefore forces a
 * decision rather than allowing an omission.
