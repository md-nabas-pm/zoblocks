 * The path mappings, checked in both places they have to exist.
 *
 * Registry components import each other by the path the ZoBlocks CLI writes into
 * a consumer's project — `@/components/zoblocks/accordion`, `@/lib/zoblocks-switch`
 * — so those specifiers have to resolve in this repository too, and separately
 * in the docs app, which resolves from its own directory and cannot extend the
 * root file.
 *
 * The root map is generated and has been since four components were found
 * importing siblings that did not resolve. The docs map was not: it held three
 * of ten component specifiers, hand-written, and the seven that were missing
 * were not missing on purpose. They were simply unimportable, so nobody could
 * write a preview for them, so six components on the docs site rendered "Live
 * preview coming with the next release" — which reads as a roadmap rather than
 * as a missing line in a config file.
 *
 * Both are generated now. This asserts they agree, that every target exists,
 * and that the docs app's own tsconfig carries what the generator emits — the
 * last being the step a human still performs, and therefore the one that can
 * still drift.
