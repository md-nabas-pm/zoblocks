/**
 * DatePicker — one temporal control, sixteen variants.
 *
 *     <DatePicker variant="picker"     label="Appointment date" now={today} />
 *     <DatePicker variant="birth-date" now={today} allowEstimated allowAbsent />
 *     <DatePicker variant="session"    durationPresets={org.presets} />
 *     <DatePicker variant="slots"      set={availability} now={now} />
 *     <DatePicker variant="date-range" months={2} presets={dateRangePresets(today)} />
 *
 * **Why one component rather than sixteen.** A clinician does not shop for a
 * "birth date field". They reach for the date control, and it needs to behave
 * differently in sixteen places: a service date they already know, an
 * appointment they have to be shown, a birth date that wants an age beside it,
 * a session that is three numbers with two degrees of freedom, a course of
 * treatment that is a rule rather than a date, and a signed timestamp that is
 * a legal instrument. Splitting those into sixteen catalogue entries hides
 * the thing that makes them a system — that every one of them shares a value
 * space, a keyboard model and an accessibility contract. Tabs made the same
 * call for the same reason.
 *
 * The variants are not a switch statement standing in for design. Each is a
 * real component in `@/lib/zoblocks-datetime-parts`, separately testable and
 * separately rendered; `variant` is the front door.
 *
 * **Ant Design parity holds for the default.** `variant="picker"` matches
 * antd's `DatePicker` — `picker`, `disabledDate`, `allowClear`, `status` — so
 * a migration is one changed import line. The one divergence is the value
 * type: ours is a plain `ZbDate`, not a `Dayjs`, because putting a date
 * library in the graph of every form component is exactly what ADR 0010 exists
 * to prevent, and because a `Dayjs` birth date is representable as midnight
 * UTC, which is the single most common temporal defect in healthcare software.
