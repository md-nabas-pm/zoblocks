/**
 * The parts of the date, time and session system.
 *
 * Thirteen presentations of one temporal contract, in one module rather than
 * thirteen catalogue entries. That is a product decision and worth stating:
 * a clinician does not shop for a "birth date field", they reach for the date
 * control and need it to behave differently in a dozen places. Tabs made the
 * same call for the same reason — one component, many skins, one keyboard
 * model — and splitting it would have hidden the argument that the skins are
 * the same component.
 *
 * So `DatePicker` is the public surface and its `variant` selects one of
 * these. Each is still a real, separately testable component: composition did
 * not become a switch statement, it became an internal module.

/**
 * DateField — a date typed in eight keystrokes, with no calendar at all.
 *
 *     <DateField label="Date of service" now={today} value={date} onChange={setDate} />
 *
 * The control most date pickers are missing, and the one most healthcare
 * fields actually want. Count what a clinician touches in a day: a date of
 * birth at intake, a service date on every note, a signature timestamp on
 * every signed note, and — perhaps twice a week — an appointment picked from a
 * calendar. The calendar is the rare case. The common case is somebody who
 * already knows the value and needs the software to get out of the way, and
 * for them a popover is four clicks where eight keystrokes would do.
 *
 * So there is no popup here. `DatePicker` is the one with a calendar; this is
 * the field, and it is deliberately the plainest thing in the family.
 *
 * Three segments, one tabstop, arrow keys that step the right unit, and a
 * segment that advances itself the moment no further digit could be valid. It
 * is impossible to enter 13 as a month or 30 February as a date, because the
 * segments are bounded and the day is checked against the month and year — not
 * validated afterwards and complained about.

 * band drawn between two months is the only thing that shows a reader what
 * they have actually selected.
 *
 * **The panel commits explicitly.** A range is built by two clicks, and the

 *
 * **The ambiguity it refuses to resolve.** Typing `9` in a twelve-hour locale

 * which. That is the whole reason `parseClockTime` returns an `ambiguous`
 * flag rather than a time.
 *

 * rapid response, a restraint application, a code narrative. Everywhere else
 * they are two more segments to tab past and two more chances to be wrong.

/**
 * SessionTimeField — start, end, duration, and a driver you can see.
 *
 *     <SessionTimeField value={session} onChange={setSession} durationPresets={org.presets} />
 *
 * Three values with two degrees of freedom. Any two determine the third, and
 * **which one is derived is the entire design problem**. A triple that
 * silently recomputes is the most common defect in scheduling software: the
 * user asserted one of the three, and which one survives the next edit is
 * information they otherwise have to discover by experiment.
 *
 * So `hold` is explicit state, and it is rendered. Change the duration and the
 * end follows, marked *Derived*; type an end and the duration follows instead,
 * and the **Held** badge moves with it. Moving the start keeps whatever was
 * asserted: hold the duration and the session slides, hold the end and it
 * stretches. Both are correct; only one can be the default, so the component
 * says which one you got.
 *
 * Two more decisions worth naming.
 *
 * **Crossing midnight is a value, not an error.** 11:30 PM to 12:30 AM is a
 * crisis-line shift and a residential handover. Refusing it teaches staff to
 * type the wrong date to get past the validator, which is how you lose the
 * real data.
 *
 * **Duration bands are data.** The component renders the band a value lands in
 * and asserts nothing. ADR 0009 prohibits a component deriving a coding
 * recommendation, and the thresholds differ by payer, by contract and by year.

 *
 * Type `07181986`. Eight keystrokes, no mouse, and the age appears beside it.
 *
 * **No calendar opens by default, and when one does it opens on the year.** A
 * date-of-birth calendar that opens on the current month has decided the
 * patient was born this month, and navigating back four hundred and eighty
 * months is not an interaction anybody designed — it is one nobody thought
 * about.
 *
 * **The age is the proof-read.** A transposed year is invisible in
 * `07/18/1968` and screaming in *58 years old*. Under two years it reads in
 * months and under four weeks in days, because a paediatric chart that says
 * "0 years old" for a four-month-old has discarded the only number that
 * mattered.
 *
 * **A partial date is a real date.** FHIR permits `YYYY` and `YYYY-MM` for
 * `Patient.birthDate`, and homeless services, unaccompanied minors and
 * forensic intake all produce them. Coercing "born around 1962" to 1 January
 * 1962 invents a fact that will be read as precise for the rest of the
 * record's life.
 *
 * **And absence is stated.** `onChange` can emit `{ kind: "absent", reason }`,
 * which renders "Not recorded" — never an em dash, never "N/A". A registration
 * form that cannot distinguish "no date of birth" from "nobody asked" is
 * lying, and that is the same argument Switch makes for its third value.

 *
 * Read-only, and the read-only case is not a lesser one: most temporal values
 * in a record are looked at far more often than they are entered.
 *
 * **The absolute value first, the relative second.** "3 days after service" is
 * a reading aid; the timestamp is the record, and a reviewer will ask. Any
 * component that leads with "3 days ago" has made the aid the value.
 *
 * **A signature prints its zone.** Anything a legal instrument depends on
 * renders the stored instant and its IANA zone, because "8:12 AM" on a
 * countersignature is not a time until somebody says where.
 *
 * **Absence is stated, never punctuated.** Not an em dash, not "N/A" —
 * CONTENT.md is normative and lint-backed on this, and an absent value carries
 * the reason it is absent.
 *
 * **Two zones appear only when there are two.** Rendering "3:00 PM ET" to
 * somebody already in Eastern Time is noise that teaches readers to stop
 * reading zone labels, so the second line is conditional on the zones actually
 * differing.

 *
 * Behavioural health does not book appointments; it books courses of
 * treatment, and the unit is the series. Twelve Tuesdays at three o'clock is
 * one decision, and finding out in week six that two of them were never
 * available is the failure this component exists to prevent.
 *
 * **The conflicts are the host's.** Checking twelve future Tuesdays against a
 * clinician's calendar, a patient's other appointments, a room and a payer
 * authorisation is a server query — ADR 0009 forbids the component making it,
 * and the component could not answer it correctly anyway. The contract is
 * narrow: expand the rule, hand the host the candidate dates through
 * `onExpand`, render whatever verdicts come back. It does not know what a
 * conflict is.
 *
 * **Nothing is written until the button at the bottom.** Each conflict can be
 * moved to a specific alternative the host proposed, or the whole series can
 * be booked around them. Both paths state the number that will result, because
 * "twelve sessions" and "ten sessions and two gaps" are different plans and
 * only one of them is what the patient was told.

/**
 * GroupSeriesScheduler — a group, its room, its roster and its real count.
 *
 *     <GroupSeriesScheduler rule={rule} startDate={first} exclusions={closures} … />
 *
 * A group is not a repeating appointment with more people in it. It has a
 * room with a capacity, two clinicians who both have to be free, a roster that
 * is already enrolled, and a series length somebody quoted to a payer.
 *
 * **The arithmetic is the feature.** Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1 September
 * to 30 November is *26 dates*; two facility closures make it *24 sessions*.
 * A scheduler that prints the naive count has told the billing team a number
 * that will not match reality and told nine enrolled patients they are
 * attending two sessions that will not happen. The exclusions are written into
 * the series as `EXDATE`, so the count survives export.
 *
 * **Capacity is stated, never enforced here.** Whether a group may run over
 * its room's capacity is a clinical and fire-safety question, and the host
 * owns it. The component renders the numbers side by side so the decision is
 * taken with them in view.
