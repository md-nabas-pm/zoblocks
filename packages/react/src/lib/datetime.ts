/**
 * The temporal engine: values, calendar arithmetic, parsing, and the session
 * algebra. No React, no DOM, no I/O, and — deliberately — no wall clock.
 *
 * Four rules shape everything below, and each one is a decision rather than a
 * preference.
 *
 * **1. A value carries its own precision.** `ZbDate` has no time member and
 * `ZbPartialDate` has no day. That is not tidiness: `new Date("1986-07-18")`
 * is midnight UTC, which is the 17th of July in California, and a birth date
 * stored as an instant is the single most common temporal defect in healthcare
 * software. The type makes it unrepresentable rather than discouraged.
 *
 * **2. Calendar arithmetic is integer arithmetic.** A civil date is a label on
 * a calendar, not a point on a timeline, so adding a day is `+1` on a day
 * number. No floating point, no timezone, no DST, and every comparison is
 * exact. Zones enter only where an *instant* does.
 *
 * **3. Nothing reads the clock.** ENGINEERING.md §9 forbids a component
 * deciding what to render from `Date.now()`, because output that depends on
 * when it rendered cannot be visually regression-tested. Every function that
 * needs "now" takes it as an argument. There is no argless `new Date()` in
 * this file and a test asserts there never will be.
 *
 * **4. Absence is a value.** `ZbAbsentDate` carries a reason, the same way
 * Switch carries `"unknown"`. A registration form that cannot distinguish
 * "no date of birth" from "nobody asked" is lying, and CONTENT.md forbids
 * punctuating the difference away as an em dash.
