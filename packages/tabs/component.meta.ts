  summary:
    "Tabs that know what they are: a view switch, a link list, a form value or a wizard — four accessibility trees behind one silhouette.",

  tagline: "Eleven skins over one accessibility tree.",
  description:
    "Four semantic modes across eleven visual variants, with the WAI-ARIA keyboard model, five overflow strategies, and the states a clinical surface actually reaches — restricted, stale, unsaved. `as` is required and has no default, because the mode is the accessibility tree and the variant is only CSS.",
  rationale:
    "Almost every tab component solves the easy half: show one panel, hide the others, move an underline. The hard half is that “tabs” is four different components sharing a shape. A view switch owns panels and answers to arrow keys. A navigation menu is a list of links, and hijacking arrows on it destroys a keyboard user's focus the moment they press one. A segmented filter is a form value that belongs in a Form.Item. A wizard is ordered and gated. Shipping one of them and using it as all four is the most-reported tab defect in every design system audit, and it is invisible: a role=tablist wrapped around anchors spells every attribute correctly, so axe passes it. Making `as` required is the whole design — everything else follows from having said out loud what the control is.",
