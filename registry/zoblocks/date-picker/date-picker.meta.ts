  summary:
    "One temporal control with sixteen variants: field, calendar, date and time ranges, birth date, session, slots, recurrence and the read-only record.",

  tagline: "One temporal control, sixteen variants, one value space.",
  description:
    "Sixteen presentations of one value space, one keyboard model and one accessibility contract. `variant` picks the surface; the parts are separately testable components underneath.",
  rationale:
    'A clinician does not shop for a "birth date field". They reach for the date control, and it has to behave differently in sixteen places: a service date they already know, an appointment they have to be shown, a birth date that wants an age beside it, a session that is three numbers with two degrees of freedom, a course of treatment that is a rule rather than a date, and a signed timestamp that is a legal instrument. Splitting those into sixteen catalogue entries hides the thing that makes them a system — that every one shares a value space, a keyboard model and an accessibility contract — and it makes a reader choose between components before they have understood the choice. The deeper reason is that healthcare temporal input is four distinct jobs, not one: recall (the user knows the value), choose (the system knows the options), construct (the value is a structure with derived members) and witness (the value is an assertion about the past). Every general-purpose picker builds only for choose, which is the rarest of the four in an electronic record, and that inversion is why EHR date fields are the way they are.',

  /*
   * The dispatch is one file and the sixteen variants are another.
   *
   * Without this the props table is the *intersection* of sixteen prop
   * interfaces — `variant`, `value`, `onChange` — and a reader looking for
   * `set`, `providers` or `durationPresets` finds nothing at all.

The reasons differ. unavailable returns the reason a day cannot be chosen rather than a boolean, because that reason is spoken and shown, and a boolean cannot carry it. picker="week" and picker="quarter" have no healthcare workflow we have found, and a stub rendering a day grid would be worse than an honest absence. The rest is unbuilt rather than rejected. A migration from antd is not yet one changed import line.',

    "Nothing here fetches, holds, or books. Availability arrives as data with an age and every transition is reported through a callback — ADR 0009 forbids the network in component source, and the host is the only party that can reconcile a rejection anyway.",
    'The range panel commits explicitly by default and the inline calendar does not. `Calendar` keeps `commit="immediate"` so no existing use changes behaviour; `DateRangeField` opts into `explicit` because a range is two clicks and the first is often wrong.
