/**
 * Stories for DatePicker.
 *
 * Written once, consumed four ways (ADR 0007): as documentation, as the
 * visual-regression fixture, as the accessibility fixture, and — through play
 * functions — as the interaction test.
 *
 * `parameters.state` ties each story to a state declared in
 * date-picker.meta.ts, and the build asserts the two agree in both directions.
 * With sixteen variants that check is the spine of the component: the claim
 * is that all sixteen share one value space, one keyboard model and one
 * accessibility contract, and a variant with no fixture is a claim nobody can
 * check.
 *
 * Every date here is a literal. ENGINEERING.md §9 forbids the component
 * reading the wall clock, and the fixtures hold themselves to the same rule —
 * a story whose output depends on the day it ran is not a regression baseline.
