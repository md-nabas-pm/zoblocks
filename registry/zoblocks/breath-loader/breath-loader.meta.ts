  summary:
    "Three rings expanding and fading from a soft core, paced at a resting breath rather than a spinner's tempo.",

  tagline: "Three rings at a resting breath, not a spinner's tempo.",
  description:
    "Symbol-free loader cycling at roughly fifteen a minute, the rate of calm breathing. Carries no clinical imagery, so it suits any specialty, and its core accepts a customer's logo mark.",
  rationale:
    "A spinner's tempo tells a reader the system is working hard; breathing tells them they can wait. On a patient-facing screen — a results page, a portal sign-in, a check-in kiosk — the second is almost always what the product means to say. It is also the one loader in the set with no clinical symbol at all, which is what makes it safe across specialties: nothing here reads as cardiac, oncological, or obstetric to someone who is about to receive news. That neutrality is a feature, not an absence of one.",

  limitations: [
    "Not a progress source. The application supplies progress; this loader cannot show it.",
