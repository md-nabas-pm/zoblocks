  summary:
    "A disclosure widget whose headers can be read while closed, with a per-section access model for content a reader may not simply be shown.",

  tagline: "Headers readable while closed, with per-section access control.",
  description:
    "Collapsible sections with a summary slot in the header, clinical severity on the leading edge, sections that cannot be closed, and four kinds of gate between a reader and content that is governed rather than merely hidden. Ant Design's Collapse API, with the accordion mode's accessibility defects fixed.",
  rationale:
    "Every accordion assumes hidden means unneeded. In a behavioral health record it does not: what is collapsed may be a suicide-risk item, a safety plan someone needs in ninety seconds, a note the patient has a legal right to read but may not be ready to, or a substance-use record governed by a different federal rule than the chart around it. Three consequences follow, and together they are the component. Collapsed is not absent, so the header carries a summary and a severity rail. Disclosure is an event rather than a state change, so opening a governed section can require a consent, a reason code, or nothing but the reader's own choice. And content this reader cannot obtain still gets a row that says so, because deleting it claims the record is complete — which is CONTENT.md's governing rule applied to the one component whose entire job is omitting facts on purpose.",

      "Long records where most sections are not needed on most visits — charts, treatment plans, note histories.",

      "Patient-facing surfaces where the reader should choose when to see something, rather than meeting it on arrival.",
      "Ordered procedures with one step that must stay visible — a safety plan's crisis contacts.",
    ],
    avoid: [
      "Alternative views of the same region. That is a tab set, and the two patterns announce themselves differently.",
      "Content that is short enough to show in full. An accordion over four lines costs an interaction and saves nothing.",

      "As an access control. The gate is an interface affordance for a policy the application owns and enforces elsewhere.",
    ],
  },

  limitations: [
    "Not an access control. onDisclose reports that a reader asked; refusing to render is not the same as refusing to serve, and the application still owns authorisation and audit.",
    "Severity is supplied, never derived. The component will not score an instrument or decide what is urgent — that would make it clinical decision support.",
    'React cannot express hidden="until-found": React 19 serialises it as hidden="", so the attribute is upgraded after commit. Between commit and effect a closed panel is hidden but not yet findable.',
    "Requires styles/zoblocks-accordion.css, installed with accordion-core.",
    "Above roughly 200 sections, render your own windowed list over useAccordion. Virtualising breaks find-in-page, so the component does not do it silently.",
    "persistKey is not implemented. Remembering which sections a reader opened is per-product storage, and storing it for a gated section would defeat the gate.",
