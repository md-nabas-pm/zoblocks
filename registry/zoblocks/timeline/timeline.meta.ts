  summary:
    "Ant Design v6's Timeline, prop for prop, with the accessible name and the ordered-list semantics it does not ship.",

  tagline: "Ant Design's Timeline, with the semantics it does not ship.",
  description:
    "An ordered list with a rail. The API matches Ant Design v6 exactly, including the v5 names it still accepts, and takes no dependency on it. Adds a required accessible name and drops the current-step behaviour a chronology has no use for.",
  rationale:
    "antd's Timeline is a thin adapter over Steps, and it inherits two things a chronology should not have. It hardcodes current to the last item, which marks that item process — and antd's own stylesheet gives that state a dotted rail. On a wizard that reads as 'the step you are on, and it continues'. On a history it is a mark of incompleteness applied to whichever event happened to be last, and because reverse reverses the array first, on a newest-first clinical timeline it lands on the oldest event in the chart. It also inherits rc-steps' accessibility, which is none: no role, no aria-current, no way to name the list, so a page with a care timeline and an access-history timeline gives a screen-reader user two unnamed lists. Matching the API rather than wrapping it means an existing antd call site migrates by changing one import, and no consumer of a primitive inherits antd.",

  limitations: [
    "No current or activeIndex. antd hardcodes current to the last item and its stylesheet dots that item's rail; a history has no current step, so the prop does not exist here and the dotted rail is free to mean something.",
    "color accepts antd's four presets and any CSS colour, and nothing enforces a text equivalent beside it. That enforcement belongs on the clinical layer, where the vocabulary is closed.",
    "titleSpan sets --zb-timeline-title-span rather than reproducing antd's internal head-span calculation. The rendered geometry is close, not identical.",
    "The Ant Design documentation site and the 6.6.0 source disagree on mode's default — the table says end, the source falls back to start. This follows the source, and the parity test asserts against the installed version.",
    "Migrating an existing antd call site is one import plus an accessible name. The three deliberate divergences, and the dotted rail antd draws that this one does not, are written up in content/guides/migrating-from-antd-timeline.md.",
