  summary:
    "The six steps of the Stanley-Brown Safety Planning Intervention, in order, with the crisis step rendered open and uncloseable.",

  tagline: "Stanley-Brown, six steps, with the crisis step always open.",
  description:
    "A patient-facing safety plan: warning signs, coping, distraction, people to ask, professionals and agencies, and means restriction. The crisis step cannot be collapsed, empty steps say they are unfinished rather than disappearing, and the wording is a patient catalog throughout.",
  rationale:
    "A safety plan is written collaboratively in a room and read alone, often on a phone, often at the worst hour of someone's week. That reading context is the whole design. The crisis step holds the phone numbers, so it renders open and its trigger reports itself disabled — a person in crisis does not scroll, does not scan, and should not have to make a correct decision about a chevron to reach a number. The step order is the intervention rather than a layout: the escalation from what someone can do alone to who they call is the clinical content, so nothing here sorts or filters. And a step nobody has filled in says so instead of vanishing, because a five-step plan numbered one to five claims the sixth was never part of the instrument.",

        "It renders expanded and its trigger carries aria-disabled=true, which is the case APG defines: the panel is visible and the accordion prevents collapsing it. The trigger stays focusable, so a keyboard or screen-reader user lands on it and hears the label rather than tabbing past it.",

    "Default wording is English and patient-facing. A clinician-facing surface needs its own catalog, not a tone change.",
    "No expiry logic. Whether a plan is stale is a clinical judgement, so revisedAt is displayed rather than interpreted.",
