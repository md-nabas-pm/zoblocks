  summary:
    "Two strands of dots turning on a slow sine. For the parts of a product that are laboratory rather than bedside.",

  tagline: "Two strands on a slow sine. For the laboratory.",
  description:
    "Loader for genomics, pathology, and diagnostics surfaces. Depth comes from scale and opacity rather than a 3D transform, so the strands cross convincingly while staying cheap to composite.",
  rationale:
    "The most specific loader in the set, and deliberately so. Sequencing, pathology, and diagnostics screens are waiting on analysis rather than on a person, and a cardiac mark says the wrong thing there — as does a generic ring, which says nothing at all. Depth is faked with scale and opacity rather than a 3D transform because a rotateY helix renders differently across browsers and costs a layer per dot; eighteen phase-offset dots on one keyframe read as a rotation and cost nothing.",

  guidance: {
    use: [
      "Laboratory, genomics, pathology, and research surfaces where analysis is the thing being waited on.",
      "Wide containers — it is a landscape mark and wants at least 48px of width.",
      "Waits long enough to be worth a domain mark. Under about 400ms the strands never complete a rotation, and an animation cut off mid-cycle reads as a stall rather than as progress.",
    ],
    avoid: [
      "General application waits. It is domain-specific by design; Breath Loader is the neutral choice.",
      "Small or square containers — the strands collapse into a row of dots.",

  limitations: [
    "Not a progress source. Use Infusion Loader when the remaining time is known.",
    "Requires styles/zoblocks-loader.css, installed with loader-core.",
    "Eighteen animated nodes — the heaviest of the five, though still compositor-only.",
    "Depicts no real sequence data. It is a mark, not a visualisation.",
