    "A capture surface that cannot lie about whether it is listening. Five arts over one signal engine, and thirteen failure modes it can tell apart.",

  tagline: "It cannot lie about whether it is listening.",
  description:
    "Ambient documentation, dictation, voice messaging and transcript review. Five arts — pulse, bars, strip, duet, stream — over one engine, with an analyser-driven meter, a silence budget and thirteen device faults.",
  rationale:
    "Every voice recorder on the web animates on a timer. An OS mute, a Bluetooth profile switch and a swapped device all deliver digital silence on schedule, and a timer cannot tell that from a quiet room. This one draws only what the analyser reports, then names which of the thirteen faults it is.",

      "As proof that audio was captured. It reports thirteen faults and there are more; recording the wrong microphone produces plausible room tone and passes every one of them.",
      "Starting a restricted or Part 2 recording from the strip art. A control that quiet is not where a disclosure should begin.",
      "As a consent mechanism. It renders a basis the host asserts and refuses to start without one; it does not obtain consent and does not know what a lawful basis is.",

  },

  limitations: [
    "It does not move bytes. No upload, no retry, no queue, no recogniser — it renders where a recording is and the host is responsible for getting it there.",
    "Duet needs a peaks sidecar and one speaker byte per bucket, emitted at ingest. Without diarisation it renders a single rail rather than guessing.",
    "Consent copy, disclosure wording and mid-session redaction are deliberately unbuilt, pending clinical and legal review. consent is a typed opaque object the component renders and never authors.",
    "Requires styles/zoblocks-recorder.css, installed with recorder-core. Without it the arts render as unstyled markup.",
