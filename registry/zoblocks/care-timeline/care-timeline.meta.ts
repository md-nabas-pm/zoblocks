  summary:
    "A patient's chronology that cannot be rendered without saying what it is a view of — the window, the sources, the filters and the order.",

  tagline: "A chronology that states its window, sources, filters and order.",
  description:
    "A timeline over clinical, administrative, communication and patient-reported events, with coverage as a required prop. Separates planned from happened, keeps an entry recorded in error visible and marked, and refuses to collapse anything a reader would act on.",
  rationale:
    "A table is read as rows and a chart as a shape, but a timeline is read as an account — and an account is understood to be continuous, so a gap in it becomes a fact. Meanwhile the timeline on screen is nearly always a slice: paginated to five, filtered to one register, assembled from sources that fail independently. Every one of those renders as the same tidy, confident, continuous list. A clinician reads a timeline with no imaging on it and orders a CT; the study was done eleven weeks ago at another hospital and the exchange query timed out four seconds earlier. Nothing was wrong on screen. So coverage is required in the type, with no default, because every plausible default is a claim the caller did not make — and the sentence it produces is rendered in a fixed place and printed. Two consequences follow: planned is not happened, so a future event sits above a now marker and a planned event whose time has passed with nothing against it is lapsed rather than silent; and clinical events are not administrative ones, so registers are typed rather than mixed at one weight.",

    "No swimlane layout. One lane per source is the right answer for a medico-legal chronology and it needs horizontal scroll, its own keyboard model and a legend.",
    "Duration events render at their start. A period is not a point, and bands are not in this version.",
    'role="feed" is not used. It is the APG\'s own pattern for an infinitely scrolling list and its example carries a note that it has not reached task-force consensus; load-older is a real button instead.',
    "Dates are formatted by Intl at the record's precision, and a stamp with an offset renders in the record's zone rather than the reader's. Pass localeTag to control the language; there is no per-field format override yet.",
    "The commonest way to defeat the coverage claim is upstream: catching a source's failure in the data layer and returning a shorter array. See content/guides/populating-coverage.md — the component cannot detect what never reached it.",
