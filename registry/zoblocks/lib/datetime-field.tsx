/**
 * The React core shared by every date and time control: the segmented field,
 * the calendar grid, and the small pieces both of them render.
 *
 * Split from `@/lib/zoblocks-datetime` on purpose. That module is the temporal
 * engine — pure, synchronous, serialisable in and out, and testable to the
 * year 2400 without a DOM. This one is the behaviour: roving tabstops, typing
 * buffers, focus management and ARIA. Keeping them apart is what lets four
 * thousand timezone assertions run in milliseconds and what makes it obvious,
 * when something is wrong, which half to look in.
 *
 * The segmented field is the highest-leverage control in the set. A clinician
 * touches a date forty times a day, and the difference between eight
 * keystrokes and four clicks is the difference between a component people use
 * and one they route around. Four defects were found by driving an earlier
 * prototype of it from a console rather than by reading it, and each one has a
 * comment here saying what it was.

 * Keeps a segment buffer in step with a controlled value — including the case

 *
 * A segmented field cannot render straight from its value: half of "0826" is
 * not a date, so the buffer has to be state. That state then has to be
 * reconciled with the prop, and an effect keyed on the value cannot do it. A
 * controlled host that rejects a change re-renders with the *same* value it
 * had before, so nothing in the dependency array changes, the effect never
 * runs, and the field goes on showing the value the host just refused. That is
 * the oldest bug in controlled inputs and the one React's own `<input>` avoids
 * by rewriting the DOM value on every render.
 *
 * So the comparison happens on every render, against what this field last
 * emitted rather than against the previous prop. Sync when they disagree; stay
 * out of the way when they do not, which is what protects a half-typed buffer
 * from the parent's one-keystroke-stale echo. `valueKey` is a serialisation
 * rather than the value itself because temporal values are plain objects and a
 * host that maps over them produces a new identity for the same date.
 *
 * Returns the function to call with each emitted value, so the field records
 * what it asked for.
