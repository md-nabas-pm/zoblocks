  summary:
    "A capsule with a soft slug — the only loader in the set that can tell the truth about how much is left.",

  tagline: "The only loader here that can honestly show progress.",
  description:
    "Determinate and indeterminate progress in one component. Pass progress for a real 0–100 measurement with role=progressbar; omit it and the slug drifts as an honest unknown.",
  rationale:
    "Named for the one device in a hospital that displays a percentage and means it. The two modes are deliberately different animations rather than one animation with a value bolted on: a determinate bar that also drifts tells a reader a measurement is moving when it is not, and on an import, a batch upload, or a records transfer, movement is exactly the fact being watched. It is the only loader here that should ever carry a number, and only when the application genuinely knows it — a fabricated percentage parked at ninety is worse than a loader that never claimed to know.",

  limitations: [
    "Does not compute progress. The application supplies the number and owns its truthfulness.",
