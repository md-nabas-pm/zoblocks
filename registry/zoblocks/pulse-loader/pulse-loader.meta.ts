  summary:
    "An open heart with a rhythm line running through it, beating at a resting sixty. The library's signature wait.",

  tagline: "An open heart at a resting sixty. The signature wait.",
  description:
    "Page and region loader: an open heart that draws itself once, then beats at a resting 60bpm while a monitor sweep crosses the rhythm line. Renders as Rhythm Loader below 40px, where the heart's detail would collapse.",
  rationale:
    "A page loader is the first thing a clinician or a patient sees, it plays while the system is at its most fragile, and it is judged in the first three hundred milliseconds. This one is built from measured cardiac timing rather than from a spinner's tempo: sixty beats a minute is a resting sinus rhythm, the beat scales by seven percent so it is noticed peripherally and never tracked, and the heart draws in once rather than once per loop so the animation has no seam. Every colour is a semantic token and the whole thing is SVG and CSS, which means it renders before any JavaScript bundle has loaded — the one requirement a page loader has that a component loader does not.",

      detail:

    {
      label: "Reduced motion is a designed state",
      detail:
        "Under prefers-reduced-motion the heart completes, the track comes to full strength, and the mark breathes in opacity. Nothing scales and nothing travels. Pausing mid-sweep would look like a component that failed.",
    },
    {
      label: "Below the flash threshold",
      detail:
        "Clamped to 40–100bpm, so the fastest cadence is 1.67Hz against WCAG 2.3.1's three-flash limit, and the beat changes scale by seven percent rather than luminance.",

  guidance: {
    use: [
      "Application boot and full-page route changes, where the brand moment is worth the space.",
      "Waits of unknown length over about 300ms. Pair with delay so a fast response never flashes it.",
      "At 56px or larger. Below 40px it deliberately renders the rhythm line instead.",
    ],
    avoid: [
      "Resuscitation, cardiac arrest, oncology, and bereavement workflows — a beating heart reads as glib there. Use Rhythm Loader or Breath Loader.",
      "Layouts you already know the shape of. A skeleton that matches the content is better than a spinner over it.",
      "As a progress indicator. It never claims to know how long is left; use Infusion Loader when the answer is known.",
    ],
  },

  limitations: [
    "Not a progress source. The application supplies progress; the loader only renders it.",
    "Requires styles/zoblocks-loader.css, installed with loader-core. Without it the loader renders as a static mark rather than an animated one.",
    "One cardiac rhythm. It does not depict arrhythmia, and it must never be read as a patient's actual rate.",
