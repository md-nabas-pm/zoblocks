  summary:
    "A floating clinical copilot: a dock above the chart that takes a question and opens into a sourced, auditable thread.",

  tagline: "A chart dock that answers with sources and an audit trail.",
  description:
    "Model-agnostic clinical assistant with mode-level scope contracts, inline source attribution, a deterministic crisis interrupt, and FHIR audit output. The engine and the accessibility behaviour ship as npm packages; this item is the Tailwind skin over them.",
  rationale:
    "The floating dock and the streaming text are two weeks of work and compete with a hundred free widgets. The parts that are hard are deciding what the model may see, proving where an answer came from, keeping chart text from being read as instructions, and knowing whether the thing makes clinicians better or worse. Those are what a digital-health team cannot build in a sprint, and they are what this component is. The design target is not a better answer — it is verification that costs less than acceptance, because automation bias is an effort asymmetry rather than a character flaw, and incorrect decision support has been measured making clinicians worse than no decision support at all.",

  guidance: {
    use: [
      "Clinician-facing reference lookup, where no patient data reaches the model at all. This is the safest first deployment and needs no BAA covering PHI in the model call.",
      "Record summarisation before an encounter, once a context resolver is wired and the scope strip can show what was read and what was withheld.",
      "Behavioral health measurement-based care — instrument trends restated from what was documented, which generates no clinical recommendation.",
    ],
    avoid: [
      "Patient-facing surfaces. Copilot throws rather than rendering: Illinois, Nevada and Utah each regulate AI in mental health differently and Nevada prohibits it outright. A patient-facing product is a separate product with a separate regulatory footing.",
      "Any moment the clinician is mid-procedure — administering medication, signing orders, in a documented timeout. Pass `suppressed` and the component removes itself entirely.",
      "Autonomous action. Copilot proposes; a human commits, and provenance attributes the act to the human. There is no configuration that changes this.",
      "Differential generation before you have evaluated your own stack. Below roughly 70% reliability, automation makes performance worse than no automation.",
    ],
  },

  limitations: [
    "Not clinical decision support as any regulator defines it, and not a medical device. The obligations belong to the team that ships it.",
    "The crisis classifier is deterministic and rule-based. It is tuned so that clinical documentation ('denies SI', 'C-SSRS negative') does not escalate, which is what makes it usable in psychiatry — but it is a floor, not a substitute for a risk protocol.",
    "Built-in crisis lines are a development default. 988 is US-only; a host must supply its own for production.",
    "Copilot cannot secure a backend. It guarantees the shape of what it sends and the provenance of what it renders; it cannot stop a host wiring an agent with standing EHR write access behind it.",
    "Requires @zoblocks/copilot-react and @zoblocks/copilot-core from npm. The engine is deliberately not inlined — a safety control nobody reads before pasting is not a safety control.",
