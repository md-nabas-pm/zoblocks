  summary:
    "A clinical note editor that records where every character came from, and refuses to let anyone sign what they have not read.",

  tagline: "A note editor that records provenance and gates the signature.",
  description:
    "LOINC-coded sections, per-range provenance across six origins, a composable sign gate with three severities, and deterministic FHIR, XHTML and plain-text output. The engine ships as an npm package with no DOM; this item is the Tailwind skin over it.",
  rationale:
    "A rich text editor is a solved problem and competes with a hundred free ones. The parts that are hard are knowing which passages were copied forward from a note about a different admission, proving a clinician actually read the text a model drafted before signing it, and producing bytes that hash the same way twice so a signature over them means something. A 2022 analysis of over 100 million notes found 50.1% of note text duplicated from prior documentation on the same patient; copy-and-paste has been implicated in roughly a third of errors in ambulatory patient-safety analyses; and CMS's July 2025 signature guidance treats an AI scribe exactly as it treats a human one, which makes the review gate the only thing standing between a clinician and words they never read. Note bloat, copy-paste error and AI attribution are one missing data structure seen three times. This component stores it.",
